GVRS-formatted files and other data files for supporting tests are included under the resources directory.


Test000_ReadPrimitives     tests ability to read data primitives stored according to Gridfour specification
Test001_ReadRecords        tests ability to read record structures from GVRS file and exercises
                              random-access operations. Also performs optional checksum calculation.
